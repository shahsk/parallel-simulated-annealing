This project contains implementation of Parallel Simulated Annealing optimization algorithm with
> parallel compuation implemented using Massage Passing Interface (MPI).

> Please go to my Master's Thesis to understand the algorithm and its implementation: Shridhar Shah, "Musculoskeletal simulation of upper extremity motion: Effect of selective muscle weakness and application to rehabilitation" University of Delaware, Summer 2009.

> or visit: "https://sites.google.com/site/shridharshah/projects" for the algorithm flow chart.

> This implementation is adapted from Bill Goffe's simulated annealing algorithm implementation
> in FORTRAN for serial computation. Please go to "http://netlib2.cs.utk.edu/opt/simann.f" to learn
> about the original algorithm.

> The present file will not compile as is. This is a portion of actual implementation and a function "COSTFUNCTION" is not implemented here.
> This file is for reference for someone who wants to implement Parallel Simulated Annealing algorithm with MPI. I am sharing this file with belief that
> someone can benefit from this implementation and adept for their own implementation.

I will modify this file to provide a sample cost function, update file with more comments and streamline the implementation in future.
